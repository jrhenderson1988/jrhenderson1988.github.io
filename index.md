title: A Newcastle based Software Engineer
---

I'm a software engineer and consultant, working as a Senior Developer at [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/).

I live and breathe software engineering and find that my interests mostly lie within microservices, distributed systems, search engines and learning new languages. I'm a full-stack developer but find that I much prefer working on the back end and I'm passionate about Kotlin, Java, Python and Go.
