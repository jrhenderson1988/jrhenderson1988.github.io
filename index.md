title: A Newcastle based Software Engineer
---

I'm a software developer and consultant, working as a Senior Developer at [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/).

I live and breathe software engineering and find that my interests mostly lie within microservices, distributed systems, search engines and learning new languages. I'm also passionate about Java, Kotlin, Python and Go.

If you'd like to know more, find out more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}).
