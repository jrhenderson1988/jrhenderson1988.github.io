title: A Newcastle based software engineer
---

I'm a software engineer based near Newcastle, UK.

I live and breathe software engineering and find that my interests mostly lie within the areas of microservices, distributed systems, search engines and learning new languages.

I'm a full-stack developer but find that I much prefer working on the back end. I like Java, Kotlin, Rust, Go and Python.
