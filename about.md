I'm a software engineer and consultant, working as a Senior Developer at [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/).

I'm passionate about Java, Kotlin and Python (and interested in Go) but very much a polyglot programmer, having used significantly more languages during my time. I live and breathe virtually anything to do with software development but find that my interests primarily lie within microservices, distributed systems, search engines and learning new languages.

Throughout my career I've worked on some interesting projects, from travel agency websites and marketing intelligence applications to car-sharing services and trading platforms in the financial sector.

Much of my working life has been spent building Laravel applications with PHP and doing a considerable amount of frontend JavaScript. However, during my time with Scott Logic and in my own time I've found time to explore a variety of different technologies such as C# and .NET, Go, backend JavaScript with Node.js, TypeScript with a deep-dive into the AWS ecosystem.

I've used many frameworks such as Spring, Django, Laravel and Express as well as frontend technologies such as React, Angular and Vue. I consider myself to be a full-stack developer but I lean much more towards the backend.
